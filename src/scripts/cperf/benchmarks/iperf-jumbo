# There is a reason for this Shell script being so weird
# (by using `set -e' and `echo $out | ...'):
#
# If a benchmark script fails it MUST exit with a non-zero status. Thus
# we make sure that the status returned reflects the benchmarks results
# and NOT the commands that extract the desired portion of the benchmarks
# output. (Last time I checked, even with `set -e ', a plain pipe will
# exit with status 0 even if one of the commands does not).

set -e

# The actual benchmark.
out=$(cd src; sudo program/snabbnfv/selftest.sh bench)

# Extract floating point Gbits number from output.
echo "$out" | grep IPERF-JUMBO | cut -d " " -f 2
